- 👋 Hi, I’m @s-young8
- 👀 I’m interested in analysing how climate change and grazing practices contribute to changes observed in climate sensitive regions of the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to analyse satellite imageries through R. Tough return to R and coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really - the learning curve is steep!
