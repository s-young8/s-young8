- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @s-young8
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analysing how climate change and land use by humans contribute to changes observed in species spatial distribution and community composition in high altitude and high latitude regions.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to analyse satellite imageries through R.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really - the learning curve is steep!
