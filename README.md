Hello, my name is Sherry Young (she/her) and I am a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University interested in analysing how climate change and land uses contribute to changes observed in species spatial distribution and community composition in high altitude and high latitude regions over several decades.

Iâ€™m currently learning to analyse satellite imageries using Google Earth Engine and tracking plant and mammal phenology through R.

Iâ€™m looking to learn more about data sciences, spatial analysis and overall statistical critical thinking and tools. I am eager to collaborate!
